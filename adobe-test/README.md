# Frontend Test

This is the completed prototype of the frontend test. Demo available here:


## Gettings Started

Navigate to the test directory and start a server. One way to do it (my preference):
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 6868
```

If you want to edit the CSS, edit the SASS and compile:
```
sass --watch sass:css
```
