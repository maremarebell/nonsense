  <h2>Q: How do I redeem points for Award Flights?</h2>

  <p>A: In addition to storing your account information on a magnetic stripe on the back of your card, chip cards also keep your account information on a small electronic chip. Since the chip uses encryption technology, your transaction information is very secure, and your card is almost impossible to reproduce. The JetBlue Card is a chip-and-signature card with PIN capability for use at unattended terminals – offering U.S. cardmembers optimal acceptance and convenience when traveling internationally</p>
