                            <p>"Cookies" are small computer files that are automatically placed on your computer's hard drive when you are connected to a website or remote server so that the website can recognize you upon your return to the website and tailor your experience based on your earlier use of the site and, in some cases, your earlier use of other sites. Our cookie does not collect information from your hard drive; rather, it allows us to recognize you and know how you navigated through our site. It is also part of our effort to detect and stop fraud. "Action tags" (also known as Web Beacons, Trackers, or Bugs) are invisible pixel .gif files placed on web pages that are used to track web navigation to those pages. </p>

                            <p>Companies that place our banner ads on other websites ("ad servers") also use action tags to understand how a person navigates on our site after responding to one of our banner ads. Any information collected is never linked to an individual and is only used in aggregate with other information generated by visitors to our site. You have the right to elect not to participate in this anonymous tracking of information, which is used to select which ads to display when you visit certain websites. In order to determine your comfort level with these companies' information practices you should review their privacy policies.
