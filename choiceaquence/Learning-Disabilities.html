        <h1>Let's Choose Game for Learning Disabilities (LD)</h1>
	<p>Let's Choose&trade; card games for  home and school are ideal games for children with learning disabilities. Learning disabilities are neurologically based and make it difficult for people with LD to acquire certain academic and social skills. A learning disability does not go away. However, skill training and compensatory strategies allow children with learning disabilities to succeed in school and go on to be successful in their careers.</p>
	<p><span class="bld">Learning Disabilities in the U.S.</span></p>
	<p>According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 15% of the U.S. population, or one in seven Americans, has some type of learning disability.</p>
	<p>According to the National Center for Learning Disabilities (NCLD), "healthy social and emotional skills are the most consistent indicators of success for people with LD, even more so than academic factors." A child's ability to learn and establish social strategies and to maintain meaningful friendships will positively impact him/her into adulthood.</p>
	<p>For some students with learning disabilities, appropriate social skills do not come easily. Again, NCLD states: "You need to teach it. Also, help provide alternatives to social interactions. Provide a model, a strategy, or thought process, to assist them in learning new ways of approaching things."</p>
	<p><span class="bld">Let's Choose Addresses Social Skills as well as Learning Disabilities</span></p>        
	<p>Many children with learning disabilities have social skills problems because they miss aspects of language in social interactions, such as jokes, and slang. In addition, they might not understand as well in quick conversations due to slower processing.</p>
	<p>Separate from language learning disabilities, a nonverbal learning disability almost always imply social skills issues.</p>
	<p>We designed the Let's Choose&trade; card games as social skill and behavior management tools to help children recognize their behaviors as choices, and that with those choices there are natural consequences. As the teacher or parent, over time you also learn to identify the natural consequences in a heated moment. It allows you and other caretakers to be consistent with children. Let's Choose&trade; presents games for kids with learning disabilities that both teach important learning and behavioral skills while also being fun.</p>
	<p><span class="bld">The Let's Choose Game Supports Classroom and At Home Learning</span></p>
	<p>Let's Choose&trade; for the Classroom, <a href=http://shop.lets-choose.com/Lets-Choose-for-the-Classroom-Lets-Choose-for-the-Classroom.htm>the school edition</a>, includes specific choices and consequences that might come up in a classroom such as:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Choices: arguing, interrupting, talking nicely, taking turns, raising your hand</li>
	<li>Consequences: receive a compliment, apologize, sit down, work with a friend, share with your family</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Choice-a-Quence&trade; Home Edition, <a href=http://shop.lets-choose.com/Lets-Choose-for-the-Home-Lets-Choose-for-the-Home.htm>the home edition</a>, includes specific choices and consequences that families might experience such as:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Choices: Be a bad loser, ask permission, not ask permission, play together nicely, talk about your anger</li>
	<li>Consequences: get a hug, get a high five, others not want to play with you, lose a fun activity</li>
	</ul>

    <h2>Let's Choose Game Benefits for Adults</h2>
    <p>Parents and teachers also benefit from using the Let's Choose&trade; Card Games. The products give caregivers real tools to use with children, including descriptive pictures that children understand. Having the pictures displayed at home on a refrigerator or on a bulletin board at school are a reminder to deal with behaviors right away -- like praising children for their positive choices or dealing with disruptive behavior quickly before it gets out of hand. For example, when a mom notices her son putting things where they belong, she should use the picture cards to point out his good behavior and the consequence that follows, "get a smile."</p>
