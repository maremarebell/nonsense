        <h1>Developing Social Skills in Children with ADHD</h1>
        <p>At Let's Choose, we realize that real consequences for good choices are subtle, like a smile from the teacher.  So we designed these behavior management tools to help children learn over time that their behavior is a choice that comes with natural consequences. As the teacher or parent, over time you also learn to identify the natural consequences of the actions you take in a heated moment. It allows you and other caretakers to be consistent with children.</p>
	<p>Let's Choose creates games for kids with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), commonly referred to as Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), that simultaneously teach important behavior skills.</p>
        <p><span class="bld">Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</span>
	<p>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that between 3 and 7% of school-aged children are diagnosed with ADHD with an even higher prevalence reported in some communities.</p>
	<p>The importance of developing social skills cannot be over stated. The National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies (NACCRRA) describes social skills as the number one predictor of life success.</p>
	<p><span class="bld">ADHD and its Impact on Social Skill Development</span>
	<p>According to the National Resource Center on AD/HD, which is part of Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD), the nation's leading non-profit organization serving individuals with AD/HD and their families:</p>
	<p>"Social skills are generally acquired through incidental learning: watching people, copying the behavior of others, practicing, and getting feedback. Most people start this process during early childhood. ... The finer points of social interactions are sharpened by observation and peer feedback. ... Children with ADHD often miss these details. They may pick up bits and pieces of what is appropriate but lack an overall view of social expectations."</p>
	<p>CHADD also reported that part of social skills training must include practice in a variety of environments, including home and school with both parents and teachers.</p>
	<p><span class="bld">Using the Let’s Choose Games to Develop Social Skills</span>
	<p>Our Let's Choose learning products help teach children with ADD (ADHD) the specific skills that they otherwise do not recognize, and provide tools for direct instruction on social skills and behavior.</p>

	<p>Once a family or classroom has learned the vocabulary, they will be able to use Let's Choose to deal with real life choices that children make and the consequences that follow. Children know that each choice they make has a logical consequence that follows. After using the picture cards in nonthreatening situations they are ready to accept consequences for the choices they make. Mom or the teacher is not just being mean. If at school a child is caught teasing she realizes that a consequence will follow. A teacher will first show her the choice card teasing and then the consequence card, apologize.</p>
        <p><span class="bld">The Let’s Choose Game Supports Classroom and At Home Learning</span></p>
	<p>Let's Choose, <a href=http://shop.lets-choose.com/Lets-Choose-for-the-Classroom-Lets-Choose-for-the-Classroom.htm>the school edition</a>, includes specific choices and consequences that might come up in a classroom such as:</p>
        <ul>
	<li>Choices: arguing, interrupting, talking nicely, taking turns, raising your hand</li>
        <li>Consequences: receive a compliment, apologize, sit down, work with a friend, share with your family</li>
	</ul>
        <p>Let's Choose, <a href=http://shop.lets-choose.com/Lets-Choose-for-the-Home-Lets-Choose-for-the-Home.htm>the home edition</a>, includes specific choices and consequences that families might experience such as:</p>
        <ul>
	<li>Choices:</span> Be a bad loser, ask permission, not ask permission, play together nicely, talk about your anger</li>
        <li>Consequences:</span> get a hug, get a high five, others not want to play with you, lose a fun activity</li>
	</ul>

    <h2>Let’s Choose Game Benefits for Adults</h2>
    <p>Parents and teachers also benefit from using the Let's Choose Card Games. The products give caregivers real tools to use with children, including descriptive pictures that children understand. Having the pictures displayed at home on a refrigerator or on a bulletin board at school are a reminder to deal with behaviors right away -- like praising children for their positive choices or dealing with disruptive behavior quickly before it gets out of hand. For example, when a mom notices her son putting things where they belong, she should use the picture cards to point out his good behavior and the consequence that follows, "get a smile."</p>
