    <h1>Who We Are &amp; What We Believe</h1>
    <h2>Cotidiana Collective</h2>
    <div class="motto">We promote tourism and embrace culture.</div>
    <!-- <h2>We recognize the extraordinary in the ordinary.</h2> -->
    <!-- <h2>definition of cotidiana: everyday, daily, quotidian</h2> -->
    <div class="right blurb">
      <p>We do our work with the highest level of</p>
      <ul>
        <li>integrity,</li>
        <li>honesty,</li>
        <li>authenticity,</li>

      </ul>

    <p>
      When we decide to travel to explore the world outside our
      own day-to-day experience, our journey simultaneously brings us
      in, and makes us think, becoming a self-exploration.  Experiencing
      life in a new context helps us to to appreciate the world in
      profound and unknown ways.  Engaging ordinary, daily activities
      in new surroundings opens up the desire to explore, fuels learning,
      and brings fresh perspectives and personal growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is our goal to encourage life-changing experiences.  We provide
      support from behind the scenes—making the right connections—between
      the destinations and companies who sell travel, and their specific
      markets.
    </p>

    <h3>Authentic always trumps contrived.</h3>
    <p>
      We market and promote the real destination—focusing on its local flavor,
     its people, its history, traditions, beauty, grit, and the unique imperfections
     that make it so special.
   </p>
    <p>
      We encourage those who travel to get to know it and those who sell it to
      love and protect it.
    </p>

    <h3>Experiential Travel</h3>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Zoning In vs. Zoning Out
    </p>
    <p>
      Cotidiana Collective believes in social responsibility and personal growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travel is an incredible tool for these agendas and this is the travel we
      concern ourselves with.  We market destinations as vehicles for self-exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The universal prerequisite for all our itineraries is contact with culture.
    </p>

    <h3>Think global.  Act local. </h3>
    <p class="subtitle">
      Support diversity, local culture and business.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work with many businesses—large and small—with the ultimate goal of
      supporting the local economy of the destinations we promote.  Cotidiana supports
      diversity, local culture and business.  We encourage real contact with the
      people of a place and cultural exchange that emphasizes respect and tolerance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tourism industry often overlooks the cultural and topographic differences
      that make a destination unique and ultimately attractive to the traveler.
      We encourage the larger outbound travel companies to work with smaller size
      operations that can provide a more nuanced experience.  We expect that our
      local tour operators will work ardently to keep their product offerings fresh
      and will work to include small local businesses.
    </p>

    <h3>Travel for good.  Travel for growth.</h3>
    <p>
      Whenever possible we integrate support for local non-profits as part
      of our itinerary. In our promotion of a destination and planning of the
      familiarization trips, we plan at least a half-day of activity with a
      local community. We firmly believe in responsible business and conscious
      travel.  We also know that once a traveler interacts and builds relationships
      with locals, their love for the place grows, as does their desire to take
      care of it.
